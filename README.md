# Ads Website Prototype


What this project is meant to do is to present to the users a set of ads within a single website, while also providing them with a few features, such as offering the necessary information for each individual ad and letting the users save their preferred ads to a personal page called "favorite ads".
## How does it work?

#### The default page of the website is the Home one, which doesn't contain much (except a greeting). It's at the upper-left side of the page where you can choose to see more.

#### By selecting the All Ads tab, you will see every ad that is listed withing the website. It will look something like this:

#### On this page, you have a few options to filter the ads. You can sort them by their date (from the most recent one to the latest), but also by their price (you can either select a range, or simply get an ascending/descending order of all of them).

#### You can also insert a word or phrase in the searching bar and see if what you've written is contained in any title or description available.

#### For each ad, you have the option to check more about them by clicking the Details button, which will redirect you to a page similar to the one below.

#### You can also add the ads by clicking on the heart-shaped button on them. Too see all your favorites, you can select the "My Favorite Ads" tab on the upper-left side of the screen.
